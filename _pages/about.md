I have a background in psychology & neuroscience (Heidelberg University & LMU Munich) as well as in statistics & machine learning (LMU Munich & Tübingen University). In my research, I'm focused on cross-pollinating the fields of machine learning and statistics, looking for ways to make either more efficient.

My PhD is funded by the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/) and the [Helmholtz Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hcai-munich.com/).

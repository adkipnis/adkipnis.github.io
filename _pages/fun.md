Here's a list of fun facts about me in no particular order:

- my favorite fragrance note is myrrh
- the last three concerts I visited were by *OG Keemo*, *Godspeed You! Black Emperor*, and some jazz ensemble whose name I forgot
- I can (probably still) do a heelflip on a skateboard
- I love rewriting the lyrics to German rap songs and remaking them with Suno AI
- my favorite book is Robert Musil's *Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften*
- I beat Elden Ring (twice)
